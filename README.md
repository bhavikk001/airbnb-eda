# **Capstone Project-1 Airbnb Bookings Analysis**
Exploratory data analysis done on Airbnb Dataset

## üìù **Problem Statement**

**Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.**

**Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings (not limited to these) such as :**

1. What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
2. What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
3. Which hosts are the busiest and why?
4. Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

## **Approach used:**

The approach we have used in this project is defined in the given format-

1) Loading our data : In this section we just loaded our dataset in colab notebook and read the csv file.

2) Data Cleaning and Processing : In this section we have tried to remove the null values and for some of the columns we have replaced the null values with the appropriate values with reasonable assumptions .

3) Analysis and visualization : In this section we have tried to explore all variables which can play an important role for the analysis . In the next parts we have tried to explore the effect of one over the other . In the next part we tried to answers our hypothetical questions.

4) Future scope of Further Analysis: There are many apartments having availability as 0 , which means they could stopped their business, we can find the relation with neighbourhood with these apartments if we could dig much, various micro trends could be unearthed, which we are not able to cover during this short duration efficiently. There are various columns which can play an important role in further analysis such as number of reviews and reviews per month finding its relation with other factors or other grouped factors can play an important role.
